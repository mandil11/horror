                <p> නොනිමි පරීක්ෂණය - 1970 <br> <br>

                1970 වසරේදී, පේරාදෙණිය විශ්වවිද්‍යාලයේ මනෝ විද්‍යා අංශයේ මහාචාර්ය විමල් ද සිල්වා මහතා මෙම සිදුවීම පිළිබඳව පර්යේෂණයක් සිදු කළා. ඔහු ගම්වාසීන් සමඟ සාකච්ඡා කළ අතර, මෙම හොල්මන් සිදුවීම් වල සත්‍යතාවය ගැන සොයා බැලුවා. මහාචාර්යවරයාගේ නිගමනය වූයේ මෙම සිදුවීම් සැබෑ බවට විශ්වාස කිරීමට ප්‍රමාණවත් සාක්ෂි ඇති බවයි.මහාචාර්ය ද සිල්වා මහතා පල්ලේගම ගම්මානයේ රාත්‍රී කාලයේ රැඳී සිටිමින් පර්යේෂණ සිදු කළ අතර, ඔහුද මෙම "කළු කුමාරයා" දැක ඇති බව ප්‍රකාශ කළා. ඔහුගේ වාර්තාවට අනුව, රාත්‍රී 11:30 පමණ වන විට, ඔහු රැඳී සිටි කාමරයේ කවුළුව අසලින් කළු පැහැති හැඩයක් පහළ වී, ඔහු දෙස බලා සිට, ඉන්පසු අතුරුදන් වුණා. </p>

                <p> පසුකාලීන වාර්තා - 1980-2000 <br> <br>

                1980 දශක වල සිට, මාතලේ ප්‍රදේශයේ "කළු කුමාරයා" පිළිබඳ වාර්තා තවදුරටත් ලැබුණත්, ඒවා අඩු වෙමින් පැවතුණා. කෙසේ වෙතත්, 1995 වසරේදී, මාතලේ නගරයට පැමිණි සංචාරකයින් පිරිසක් රාත්‍රී කාලයේ මාතලේ අලවතුගොඩ පාරේ සිටියදී, කුඩා දරුවෙකු මඟ තොටේ තනිව සිටින බව දුටුවා. ඔවුන් ඔහුගෙන් ඇසුවේ කෙහෙද යන්නේ කියායි. එම දරුවා කතා නොකර, ඔවුන් දෙස බලා සිට, පසුව ඔවුන් ඉදිරියේදීම අතුරුදන් වුණා. මෙම සිදුවීම එම සංචාරකයින් මාතලේ පොලිසියට වාර්තා කර තිබෙනවා.2000 වසරේදී, මාතලේ නගරය අසල ඉදිකරන ලද නව නිවාස සංකීර්ණයක පදිංචිකරුවන් "කළු කුමාරයා" දුටු බව වාර්තා කර තිබෙනවා. මෙම නිවාස සංකීර්ණය ඉදිකරන ලද්දේ පල්ලේගම ග්‍රාමයට ආසන්නවයි. පදිංචිකරුවන්ගේ වාර්තා අනුව, රාත්‍රී කාලයේ කළු පැහැති කුඩා දරුවෙකුගේ හැඩය නිවාස වල චලනය වී ඇති අතර, සමහර අවස්ථාවලදී මෙම දරුවා නිදා සිටින දරුවන් දෙස බලා සිටින බව දැක තිබෙනවා. </p>

                <p> වර්තමාන තත්ත්වය <br> <br>

                2010 වසරින් පසුව, "කළු කුමාරයා" පිළිබඳ වාර්තා සැලකිය යුතු ලෙස අඩු වී තිබෙනවා. කෙසේ වෙතත්, ගම්වාසීන් අතර තවමත් මෙම කතාව ඉතා ජනප්‍රියයි. මාතලේ ප්‍රදේශයේ වසර ගණනාවක් තිස්සේ ජීවත් වන වැඩිහිටියන්ට අනුව, පල්ලේගම ගම්මානයේ රාත්‍රී කාලයේ තනිව ගමන් කිරීම උවදුරුදායක යැයි විශ්වාස කෙරෙනවා.දැනට "කළු කුමාරයා" දුටු බවට අලුතින් වාර්තා නොලැබුණත්, ප්‍රදේශවාසීන් තවමත් රාත්‍රී කාලයේ එම ප්‍රදේශයට යාමට බිය සහිතයි. 2018 වසරේදී, එම ප්‍රදේශයට පැමිණි පර්යේෂකයින් පිරිසක් මෙම සිදුවීම් පිළිබඳව සොයා බැලූ අතර, ඔවුන්ට කිසිදු අරුම පුදුම අත්දැකීමක් නොලැබුණත්, ගම්වාසීන්ගේ සාක්ෂි එකතු කිරීමෙන් පසු, ඔවුන්ගේ නිගමනය වූයේ මෙම සිදුවීම පැහැදිලි කිරීමට විද්‍යාත්මක පදනමක් නොමැති බවයි. </p>

                "මාතලේ කළු කුමාරයා" පිළිබඳ කතාව ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ ප්‍රසිද්ධම හොල්මන් කතා අතරින් එකක් ලෙස තවමත් පිළිගැනෙනවා. බොහෝ සාක්ෂිකරුවන් විසින් වාර්තා කරන ලද මෙම සිදුවීම අදටත් අභිරහසක් ලෙස පවතිනවා. විද්‍යාඥයින් තවමත් මෙම සිදුවීම පිළිබඳව පැහැදිලි කිරීමක් ලබා දී නැති අතර, එම නිසා "මාතලේ කළු කුමාරයා" ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ කතා බහට ලක් වූ අභිරහස්මය චරිතයක් ලෙස පවතිනවා.අදටත්, මාතලේ ප්‍රදේශයේ බොහෝ දෙනෙකු රාත්‍රී කාලයේ තනිව එම ප්‍රදේශවලට යාමට බිය දක්වන අතර, ඇතැම් දෙමව්පියන් තම දරුවන්ට "කළු කුමාරයා එයි" යනුවෙන් කියමින් රාත්‍රී කාලයේ එළියට නොයන ලෙස අවවාද කරනවා. </p>

            <p>The old Cedarville train station closed in 1957, but locals know it still serves one final passenger every night. According to legend, at exactly 3:33 AM, a ghostly steam train pulls into the abandoned station.</p>

            <p>The train appears exactly as it did in its heyday, except for two details: the engine makes no sound, and the windows reveal only darkness inside. The doors open, inviting anyone present to board.</p>

            <p>Those foolish enough to enter are never seen again. The most famous case was in 1983, when a group of teenagers dared each other to wait for the train. Security camera footage from a nearby gas station showed four teens entering the station, but only three running out in terror moments later.</p>

            <p>The missing teen's backpack was found on the platform the next morning. Inside was a one-way ticket dated 1956, the year the real train made its final scheduled run before the fatal crash that killed everyone on board.</p>

            <p>To this day, no one knows where the midnight train goes, but the conductor's final words to passengers are always the same: "All aboard for the end of the line."</p>

            <p>Sarah first noticed something was wrong with her bathroom mirror on a Tuesday morning. As she brushed her teeth, she saw her reflection blink - but she hadn't.</p>

            <p>At first she dismissed it as a trick of the light or her tired eyes. But the next day, her reflection smiled at her when she wasn't smiling. When she reached out to touch the glass, the reflection grabbed her wrist.</p>

            <p>Sarah screamed and pulled away, breaking the connection. The reflection laughed silently. Over the next week, her reflection began moving independently more frequently, sometimes mouthing words she couldn't hear.</p>

            <p>The final straw came when she woke to find her reflection already awake in the mirror, staring at her from the bed where Sarah still lay. That was impossible - the mirror only reflected what was directly in front of it.</p>

            <p>Sarah had the mirror removed, but the workers reported it was unusually heavy. As they carried it out, one claimed to see a face smiling back at him from the glass. The mirror now sits in storage, covered by a sheet, waiting for its next victim.</p>

            <p>In the remote mountains of Eastern Europe, the village of Drovnik vanished without a trace on the night of October 31, 1923. All 217 inhabitants disappeared, leaving behind full meals on tables, still-warm fires, and a single diary found in the empty schoolhouse.</p>

            <p>The diary belonged to the village schoolteacher, Anna Petrovna. Her final entries describe how the villagers began seeing "the watchers" - tall, shadowy figures that stood at the tree line, observing the village. At first there were just a few, but each night their numbers grew.</p>

            <p>On the last night, Anna wrote: "They are at every window now. The children see them too. Father Mikhail says prayers but the shadows only come closer. We can hear them scratching at the doors. The air smells of rotting earth. God help us all."</p>

            <p>Search parties found no signs of struggle or violence. The only anomaly was that every mirror in the village had been covered with cloth, and all the clocks had stopped at exactly 3:17 AM.</p>

            <p>To this day, hikers occasionally report seeing shadowy figures standing among the ruins of Drovnik, particularly on foggy nights. Some claim to hear faint whispers in an unknown language, while others report their watches mysteriously stopping at 3:17 AM when they pass through the village center.</p>

            <p>The previous owners warned the Millers about the scratching sounds in the attic. "Probably just squirrels," they said. "It stops if you ignore it." What they didn't mention was that the scratching had stopped completely the week before they moved out.</p>

            <p>The Millers heard no scratching at all during their first month in the house. Then one night, Mrs. Miller woke to find her five-year-old daughter standing at the foot of her bed. "Mommy, the man in the attic says I have to go with him now," the child said in a monotone voice.</p>

            <p>When Mrs. Miller turned on the light, she saw that her daughter's eyes were completely black. The child collapsed, and when she woke moments later, she had no memory of the incident.</p>

            <p>Over the next weeks, family members began experiencing missing time, waking in strange places with no memory of how they got there. The temperature in the house dropped steadily despite the summer heat outside. The family dog refused to enter certain rooms and growled at empty corners.</p>

            <p>A priest called to bless the house fled in terror after hearing a voice whisper his deepest secret - something only his deceased mother knew. The Millers moved out that same day, leaving most of their possessions. The current owners report no paranormal activity, but neighbors claim to sometimes see a shadowy figure watching from the attic window.</p>

            <p>Business traveler Mark Edwards checked into Room 714 of the historic Grandview Hotel expecting a routine overnight stay. His nightmare began when he stepped out of his room to get ice.</p>

            <p>The ice machine was just 20 feet from his door, but as Mark walked toward it, the hallway seemed to stretch before him. After what felt like five minutes of walking, he turned back - only to find his room door now impossibly far away.</p>

            <p>Mark ran, but the hallway only extended further. The patterned carpet and numbered doors repeated in an endless loop. His phone had no signal, and shouting brought no response. The emergency exit signs led only to more hallway.</p>

            <p>After what felt like hours, Mark noticed something even more terrifying - the room numbers were changing. He passed Room 714 three times, but the fourth time it was Room 715, then 716. The numbers were counting up as if he was moving forward through time.</p>

            <p>Mark was found unconscious in the hallway the next morning by housekeeping. Security footage shows him leaving his room, walking 20 feet to the ice machine, and then collapsing. He had no memory of the events, but investigators found his shoes worn through as if he'd walked miles, and his watch had stopped at exactly 3:17 AM.</p>

            <p>The previous owners warned the Millers about the scratching sounds in the attic. "Probably just squirrels," they said. "It stops if you ignore it." What they didn't mention was that the scratching had stopped completely the week before they moved out.</p>

            <p>The Millers heard no scratching at all during their first month in the house. Then one night, Mrs. Miller woke to find her five-year-old daughter standing at the foot of her bed. "Mommy, the man in the attic says I have to go with him now," the child said in a monotone voice.</p>

            <p>When Mrs. Miller turned on the light, she saw that her daughter's eyes were completely black. The child collapsed, and when she woke moments later, she had no memory of the incident.</p>

            <p>Over the next weeks, family members began experiencing missing time, waking in strange places with no memory of how they got there. The temperature in the house dropped steadily despite the summer heat outside. The family dog refused to enter certain rooms and growled at empty corners.</p>

            <p>A priest called to bless the house fled in terror after hearing a voice whisper his deepest secret - something only his deceased mother knew. The Millers moved out that same day, leaving most of their possessions. The current owners report no paranormal activity, but neighbors claim to sometimes see a shadowy figure watching from the attic window.</p>
